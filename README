## Summary:

applet.js does two things:
* Tests for presence of the Java Plugin potentially by version. 
* Injects applets with valid html. 

All applets are injected with the mayscript attribute set. That attribute enables liveconnect in mozilla based browser - in other browsers it's enabled by default.
